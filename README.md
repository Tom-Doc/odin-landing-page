Hello there!

So this landing page took me about 5 days and it was a handful of hours spread across those days. I started on 4/20/22 and ended on 4/27/22 and I didnt work on it over the weekend. I definitely learned a lot working on this and it really put everything I've learned to far to the test. I felt really comfortable with the HTML, minus fixing some divs, but felt lackluster with the CSS and Flexbox. I felt like the first part of the project was going smoothly CSS-wise and then I ran into some problems when making the "Bestsellers" portion and the "Sign Up" block right above the footer. I couldn't figure out how to get the text to stack on top of each other for the sign up portion, and that's why it's all just one row. I also need to work on how many classes I use, but I think that will come with time. For now I'm pretty happy with how my first big project turned out. Here's to many more!
